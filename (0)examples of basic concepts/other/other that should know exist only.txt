Security: Spring Security is a popular module for implementing security
 in Spring Boot applications. It provides authentication, authorization,
 and other security features to secure your application endpoints.

Validation: Spring Boot includes validation support through the Java Bean Validation API.
 You can use annotations such as @NotNull, @Size, and @Valid to enforce validation
 rules on request payloads and entity fields.

Configuration: Spring Boot provides various ways to configure your
 application, including application.properties or application.yml
 files, as well as external configuration sources. Knowing how to 
configure properties, profiles, and custom configuration classes is important.
